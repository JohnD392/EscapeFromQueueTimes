This document is intended to be a dump for ideas, discussions, etc.

Maps
	Existing worlds or raids?
	Spawn system?
	Extraction System?

Character control
	Faster than tarkov

Shooting
	Bullet damage
	Bullet traveltime
	Recoil
	Reload time

Health
	TTK
	Healing timing, animations
	Healing types - Broken bones, heavy/light bleeds, concussion, etc.

Loot
	Player guided?
	Flea market?

Visual style
	Realistic vs stylized
		Realism Pros:
			Realism adds to immersion
		Realism Cons:
			Very difficult to create, external assets may not conform to style
			Nonperformant
		Opposites apply to stylized, though it can be hard to find a good style


EFT Feature list
Home - Enter raid / Character / Trading / Hideout
	J - I have the sense that all of these can be handled in FPP. You start as your Character
	in the hideout, and can navigate QUICKLY to others' hideouts, traders, flea market, 
	or raid. I can't underemphasize the importance of quick and smooth transitions here.

Character - 
	Stash - 
		Fixed size until hideout is upgraded. Gets quite expensive.
		Auto sort/filters 	J - seem kinda weak
		Buy/Sell/Tasks tabs. J - Buy/Sell tab is pointless and stupid. If i click something on the trader's end i clearly want to buy it, not sell it.

	Skills -
		52 different skills 	J - with apparently no purpose whatsoever except to make no-lifers broken as fuck
		69 "Mastering"s for each gun. Don't even know what that means
		J - I hate these.

	Maps - 
		J - Did anyone know this exists? EFT in-game maps are awful

	Overall -
		Statistics about a bunch of shit. J - Pretty neat IMO, though largely inconsequential

Traders - 
	8 Traders
	3 Currencies
	4 Levels of progression each
	1 Reputation level each
	Tasks may be obtained from each at differing entrypoints
	Player may sell different sets of items for different prices. Therapist sells for most, fence buys everything for cheapest, etc.
	Player may buy set or nearly infinite amounts of each item for (mostly) static prices
	Trader tracks money spent/sold by player, influences level of trader. J - Highly exploitable, not my favorite
	Some trader items are locked behind tasks (good ammo, guns)
	Makes requests to determine the prices of items, causes poor item price load times. J - Is it really so expensive to make this call when you enter the trader tab for every trader?

Flea Market - 
	Locked to level 15
	Sorts all items into categories, e.g. gear, weapons, ammo, provisions, etc.
	Selecting an item shows all listings for that item in a long list
	Some items are banned, best ammo, best guns, etc.
	Tax system 		J - I don't fully understand it. Some tax is more than the item itself for exploitation reasons? nerfs? not sure.
	Limited to 2 items at a time. incentivizes undercutting perhaps?
	Offers

------------------------- DISCUSSION NOTES ----------------------------
Ideas:
	Security - Pay a percentage daily to protect your stash. 
		Takes $ out of the economy
		Applies a soft ceiling to progression
		Pseudo wipe


Teamkilling is ok
